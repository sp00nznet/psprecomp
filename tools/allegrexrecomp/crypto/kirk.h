/* KIRK command 1 — decrypt-and-verify.
 *
 * KIRK is the PSP's hardware crypto engine. Command 1 is the one that matters
 * for executable modules: it takes a 0x90-byte header followed by an encrypted
 * body, recovers the body's AES key from the header, verifies two CMACs, and
 * decrypts.
 *
 * Header layout (0x90 bytes):
 *
 *   0x00  16  body AES key      } AES-CBC encrypted with the KIRK1 key,
 *   0x10  16  CMAC key          } IV = 0, as one 0x20-byte run
 *   0x20  16  expected CMAC of the metadata header
 *   0x30  16  expected CMAC of the metadata header + body
 *   0x40  32  zero
 *   0x60   4  mode — 1 for KIRK1
 *   0x64   4  0 = AES CMAC, 1 = ECDSA
 *   0x68   4  zero
 *   0x6C   4  0 retail, 0xFFFFFFFF devkit
 *   0x70   4  decrypted data length
 *   0x74   4  padding length between the header and the data
 *   0x78  24  zero
 *   0x90  ..  padding, then the encrypted body
 *
 * Note that 0x60 onward is *plaintext* even though 0x00-0x3F is not, which is
 * what lets a caller read the data length before holding any key.
 *
 * The two CMACs are the reason this is worth implementing carefully rather
 * than treating decryption as a black box: they turn "did the key work?" from
 * a judgement call into a yes/no answer.
