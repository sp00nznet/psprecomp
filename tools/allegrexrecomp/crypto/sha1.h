/* SHA-1.
 *
 * Present for one specific reason: a PSP **NID** — the identifier every
 * firmware call is made by — is the first four bytes of SHA-1(function name),
 * little-endian. That makes the NID table self-verifying. Rather than trusting
 * a transcribed list of "NID = name" pairs, the test suite hashes each declared
 * name and checks it produces the NID we registered.
 *
 * A wrong name or a mistyped NID therefore cannot survive the build, which
 * matters more than it might seem: an HLE table with one entry pointing at the
 * wrong function produces a game that runs and misbehaves in a way that looks
 * like a codegen bug.
