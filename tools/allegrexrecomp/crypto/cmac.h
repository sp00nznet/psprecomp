/* AES-CMAC (RFC 4493) — the integrity check on KIRK CMD1 headers and bodies.
 *
 * KIRK uses this to authenticate a module: the CMD1 header carries a CMAC of
 * its own metadata and a CMAC of the body. We compute both and compare.
 *
 * We only ever *verify*, never sign. That distinction is the whole reason this
 * is a decryption tool and not a signing tool: verifying tells you your key
 * material and your algorithm are right, which is exactly the feedback needed
 * while bringing decryption up.
