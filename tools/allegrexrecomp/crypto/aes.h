/* AES-128/192/256 — the primitive underneath everything the PSP encrypts.
 *
 * Self-contained on purpose: the toolkit's core has no external dependencies,
 * and dragging in OpenSSL to decrypt a game module would be absurd. This is
 * ~250 lines and it is validated against the FIPS-197 and NIST SP 800-38A
 * vectors before it is ever pointed at a game.
 *
 * One deliberate choice: the S-box is *computed* at init from its algebraic
 * definition (multiplicative inverse in GF(2^8), then the affine transform)
 * rather than pasted in as a 256-byte table. A mistyped constant in a pasted
 * table produces an implementation that fails only for certain inputs, which
 * is exactly the kind of bug that survives casual testing. Deriving it means
 * the table is either completely right or obviously wrong.
