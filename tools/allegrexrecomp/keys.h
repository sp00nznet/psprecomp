/* External key material.
 *
 * PSP decryption constants are published facts in the same sense the Lynx boot
 * ROM's RSA modulus is, but they are **not distributed with this toolkit**.
 * They live in a file the user supplies, `keys/` is gitignored, and nothing in
 * this repository contains one.
 *
 * That is not only a licensing posture — it is also better engineering. Key
 * material as data rather than baked-in constants means a key can be corrected
 * without a rebuild, a wrong key produces a clear diagnostic instead of a
 * mysterious failure, and the tool can say precisely *which* named key it
 * wanted and could not find.
 *
 * Format — one `name = hex` per line, `#` starts a comment:
 *
 *     # keys/psp_keys.txt
 *     kirk1      = 00112233445566778899aabbccddeeff
 *     prx.F8710C50 = ...
 *
 * Lookup order: an explicit --keys path, then $PSPRECOMP_KEYS, then
 * ./keys/psp_keys.txt.
