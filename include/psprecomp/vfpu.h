/* psprecomp — the VFPU.
 *
 * 128 single-precision registers, addressed as 8 matrices of 4x4. A single
 * 7-bit register field can name a scalar, a 2/3/4-element row, a column, or a
 * whole matrix, depending on the instruction's width bits and a transpose bit.
 *
 * ## Register layout
 *
 * The file is indexed `v[matrix*4 + column*32 + row]`. That looks arbitrary
 * and is not: it is the layout that makes a row and a column of the same
 * matrix alias the same storage the way the hardware does. A game that writes
 * a matrix by columns and reads it by rows -- which is exactly what a
 * transpose does -- only works if this matches.
 *
 * ## What is implemented, and what deliberately is not
 *
 * Measured against a real module (WTF's Lumberjack, 1276 VFPU-space words in
 * .text), the distribution is heavily skewed: quad load/store is 48% of it,
 * and vscl/vmul/vadd/vdot another 18%. Those, plus the compare/min/max family,
 * are implemented here and unit-tested.
 *
 * The **prefix** instructions are not. `vpfxs`/`vpfxt`/`vpfxd` do not compute
 * anything -- they set a register that rewrites the *operands of the next
 * instruction*, swizzling lanes, negating, forcing constants, masking writes.
 * An arithmetic op executed while a prefix is pending computes something
 * different from the same op without one.
 *
 * So a pending prefix makes the next arithmetic op **trap** rather than
 * compute. Implementing the arithmetic while ignoring the prefixes would be
 * worse than not implementing it at all: it would produce numbers that are
 * silently wrong instead of an error that says so. Loud beats plausible.
