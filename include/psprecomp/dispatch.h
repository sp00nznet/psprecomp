/* psprecomp — the address → function dispatch table.
 *
 * Most calls in recompiled code are direct: `jal 0x1234` becomes a plain C
 * call to psp_func_00001234(). Some are not — `jalr $t9` and `jr $t9` take
 * their target from a register, and MIPS uses that for function pointers,
 * vtables, callbacks and switch tables.
 *
 * Those go through here: the generated code registers every function it
 * defines, and an indirect transfer looks the target up at run time. This is
 * the same mechanism lynxrecomp uses for computed jumps, and it is what lets a
 * partially-discovered module still run — an unregistered target is a named,
 * catchable failure rather than a jump into nowhere.
